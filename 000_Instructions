All my code is designed to work with a reporting database separate from any NAV database you are using.
To understand how that works, please check out the NAVSQL repository in my Git Hub.

Once that is done, you should run these two scripts:
100_Create Required Tables.sql
105_CreateUserTablePermissionView.sql

You do not have to run 105B. this script just shows you how you might run the query directly over a NAV Database.

Once the scripts are run, you can then use the SSRS file found below.
The report does not use any shared datasets.
It does use a shared dataset which I have not provided as you will need to create your own in any case.
